# Encoder Library For BeagleBone Black

This Library can be used to directly use to measure the encoder ticks, when connected to the eQEP Module of the BeagleBone Black.

The Library uses memory mapping, and thus reads directly from the meory registers, instead of reading from the files.

This makes the library very fast and effecient to be used in robotic systems.
